"""Explicit registration of the hermes built-in tools Enikk depends on.

Hermes 0.18+ discovers built-in tools by globbing ``tools/*.py`` on disk
(``tools.registry.discover_builtin_tools``) and importing what it finds.
Inside a PyInstaller-frozen build there are no ``.py`` files on disk —
modules live in the PYZ archive — so discovery silently registers nothing,
and tools such as ``skill_view`` vanish from the agent schema (the model
then hallucinates calls to a nonexistent ``skill`` tool).

Importing a tool module runs its module-level ``registry.register()``
calls, so the explicit imports below guarantee that every hermes toolset
Enikk enables (see ``ENABLED_TOOLSETS`` in ``eternity.py``) is present in
the registry regardless of filesystem discovery. ``memory`` and ``todo``
are also imported transitively by hermes internals, but keep them here so
the guarantee stays explicit and testable in one place.

Covered by tests/test_hermes_tools.py, which simulates the frozen
condition (discovery disabled) and asserts these tools still register.
