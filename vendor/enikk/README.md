Enikk is an AI agent that watches your screen, understands what it sees, and operates any desktop application — autonomously. It learns from experience, extracts reusable skills, and gets smarter every time you use it.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Learns from Experience
After each task, Enikk automatically reviews what happened and extracts reusable skills into persistent memory. The agent gets smarter the more you use it.

### 💰 Smart & Cost-efficient
Enikk uses a multi-layer perception system (YOLO + OCR + VLM) that minimizes AI costs. Most operations never need expensive vision models — saving you money.

### ⚡ Zero Code Required
Configure everything through the Web Dashboard. No programming, no scripts, no YAML editing — just point-and-click setup.

### 🖥️ Multi-app Support
Control multiple applications simultaneously. Enikk auto-discovers windows and can switch between apps during a task.

### 📱 Remote Control via IM
Control Enikk from your phone through chat. Send a task via QQ, and Enikk executes it on your PC while you're away.

### 👁️ Fully Observable
Watch every step in the Web Dashboard: screenshots, detected elements, reasoning, and actions. No black boxes — complete transparency.

### 🔒 Local & Private
Runs entirely on your machine. Your data, screenshots, and credentials never leave your computer (except for AI API calls).

## 🏗 Architecture

**Data flow:**
1. **Capture** — Take a screenshot of the target application window
2. **Parse** — YOLO detects UI elements, OCR reads text, results normalized to `[0,1000]` coordinates
3. **Decide** — LLM analyzes structured data and decides what to do
4. **Act** — Click, type, or wait based on the decision

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Download & Run

1. **Download** the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gtt116/enikk/releases)
2. **Unblock** — Right-click the zip → Properties → Check "Unblock" → OK
3. **Extract** the zip file (see `INSTALL.txt` in the extracted folder for details)
4. **Run** `enikk.exe`
5. **Open** — the dashboard opens automatically in a native window

That's it. No installation, no Python, no dependencies.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Windows marks downloaded files as "from the internet" which may block execution. Always unblock the zip (step 2) before extracting. If SmartScreen still appears, click "More info" → "Run anyway".
